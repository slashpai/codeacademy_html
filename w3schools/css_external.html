<!--
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of the HTML page:
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

To define a specific style for one special element, add an id attribute to the element:
Note: The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To define a style for special types of elements, add a class attribute to the element:

External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css">

This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border
