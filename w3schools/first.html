<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!--<html lang="en-US"> 
The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.

The language is declared with the lang attribute.

Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines:

    
-->

<!--
    The <head> element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Note: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.


-->
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">
 <p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--<body>-->

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<!--
    Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:


-->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

<img src="docker.svg" alt="docker" width="104" height="142">
<!--
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.

The value of the attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage, e.g. a blind person, can "hear" the element.
The alt attribute is also useful if the image does not exist:

-->

<button title="button" href="https://www.w3schools.com">Click me</button>

<ul>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

<p style="color:red">I am a paragraph</p>

<!--
    Here, a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:
-->
<p title="I'm a tooltip">
        This is a paragraph.
        </p>

<!--
    Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property
-->
<hr>
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

<!--
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.


-->

<!--
    The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
-->

<pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

<!--
    Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

-->
<p style="color:blue;font-size:20px">Styled Paragraph</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>

<!--hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

<!--rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

<!--
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.


The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the document
The <title> element specifies a title for the document
The <body> element contains the visible page content
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML lists are defined with the <ul> (unordered/bullet list) or the <ol> (ordered/numbered list) tag, followed by <li> tags (list items):

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).
Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.
HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

All HTML elements can have attributes
The title attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
The href attribute provides address information for links
The width and height attributes provide size information for images
The alt attribute provides text for screen readers
At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names
At W3Schools we always quote attribute values with double quotes

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

The font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Small text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

    Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. However, there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: <b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, but <strong> and <em> means that the text is "important".

<abbr>	Defines an abbreviation or acronym
<address>	Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document
<bdo>	Defines the text direction
<blockquote>	Defines a section that is quoted from another source
<cite>	Defines the title of a work
<q>	Defines a short inline quotation
